# “How to ask an Excellent Question” Checklist

Hi There! Use the following checklist to ask an excellent question in the course forums when you
have a problem related to python programming. Either myself or someone else will be there to help
you as quick as a flash!

1.  Make a great question title
  - [ ] I have added the [Help] Tag at the start of my title
  - [ ] My Question title is Clear and descriptive and it is obvious what the problem is
2. My Question has a complete description
  - [ ] I have written down the observed behavior (What has happened)
  - [ ] I have written down the expected behavior (What was supposed to happen)
  - [ ] I have added a link to my code using gist.github.com
  - [ ] I have mentioned what I think the problem might be and the location.
  - [ ] I have provided a list of at least 3 things that I have tried to solve the problem
  - [ ] My Description uses full sentences with correct grammar and punctuation
3. I have included other relevant information
  - [ ] Error messages in full
  - [ ] Version of python used
  - [ ] Screen shots where necessary


You did it! From the bottom of my heart, thank you so very much for using this checklist
and contributing to the course community. By asking your question in this way, you make it
a pleasure to help you and you make it easier for everyone else to learn from your
experience. So from myself and from everyone else in the community forum, THANKYOU!
All the best,
