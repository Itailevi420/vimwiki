IKJEFT01    : The load module of "TSO"

IPL         : IPL (initial program load) is a mainframe term for the loading of
              the operating system into the computer's main memory .
              A mainframe operating system (such as OS/390) contains many
              megabytes of code that is customized by each installation,
              requiring some time to load the code into the memory.

SAS/IML     : SAS/IML is an interactive matrix language that is both powerful
              and flexible. The fundamental data object on which all commands
              operate is a row by column matrix. Therefore, single elementwise
              operators such as + and / can operate on many data values to
              produce many results

SMP/E           : Software Maintenance "The system modification program"
                  keeps all package dependencies managed something like a

EYE CATCHER is a readable piece in your load module that you plant on purpose

## ALL the reg info is IN THE PSW INFORMATION
the last place the app was. is stored in the PSW in the last 4 bytes

reg 1 some data on the loadmodule

error codes
rc are stored in reg 15
rc = 0
rc = 4
rc = 8
system abbend code (_abb normal end_)

S0c7    : translation problems
S0c4    : is worse

BC      : branch conditional

e.g: --> BC 15,106(0,10)

IPCS    : is a loadmodule that helps with finding bugs in dumps

- --> jcl lab
- --> uss lab
- --> z/OS lab
- RTFM = read the fucking manual

in tapes we dont usulley put PDS, only sequential data sets.
LUN     : is a modern ssd in the mainframe that store datasets that emulates
          DASD, tapes, etc.


console numbers
```
                         check out colin paice blog
<product><xxxx><c>
$HASP1234E

I = Information
E = Error
S = Server Error

this command stops JES and you end up with a console
$PJES2

to see the init and class setup
$D I
```

errors          : d37 = space error usually use compress
