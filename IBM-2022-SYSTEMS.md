IPL         : IPL (initial program load) is a mainframe term for the loading of
              the operating system into the computer's main memory .
              A mainframe operating system (such as OS/390) contains many
              megabytes of code that is customized by each installation,
              requiring some time to load the code into the memory.

SAS/IML     : SAS/IML is an interactive matrix language that is both powerful
              and flexible. The fundamental data object on which all commands
              operate is a row by column matrix. Therefore, single elementwise
              operators such as + and / can operate on many data values to
              produce many results
