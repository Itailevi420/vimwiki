              A mainframe operating system (such as OS/390) contains many
              megabytes of code that is customized by each installation,
              requiring some time to load the code into the memory.

PR/SM           : Logical to physical mapping

SMP/E           : Software Maintenance "The system modification program"
                  keeps all package dependencies managed something like a
                  package manager on linux.

DFSMS           : "Data Facility Storage Management Service" Automated Disk Mgt
                  Basically manages Storage what data goes where and deals with
                  backups migrations copy's and all I/O management.
                  `IDGXX` is an sms prefix
DFSMShsm        : makes it easy to get the datasets that are archived .


SE              : The support element. every thing that you can do with the
                  HMC you can do with the SE.
                  usually there is 2 in a mainframe.
                  the SE contains :
                  1. LIC (_Licensed Internal Code_) used to control and monitor
                     the CPC
                  2. Loging and problem determination
                  3. hardware system definitions
                  4. IOCDS (_params dataset_)
                     that is used at POR time. (tells the mainframe how
                     to configure all the I/O and the LPAR's)
                  5. BOC (_battery operated clock_) to manage and sync time
                     between all the component's
                  6. Ethernet adapters.

HMC             : (_Hardware Management Console_)
                  usually used to start,stop,.. and manage LPAR's
                  it connects to the SE Support Element
                  1. Can connect to the SE remotely.
                  2. Add multiple mainframes to a single HMC (max 100)
                  3. Add a single mainframe to multiple HMC's (max 32)
                  4. connect to the HMC remotely

WLM             : Workload Managers the IRD extends wlm to handle sysplex loads
                  1. Builds nodes ----->
                  2. Assigns work to nodes ----->
                  3. Measures system <-----
                  4. Unpark/Parks low CP's ----->

Hyper Dispatch  : (_see also HyperSockets_) Helps WLM with response times
                  especially in large systems with lots of cors.
                  So when we virtualize a system like defining an LPAR
                  and there is work to be done, the system looks in a pool of
                  available processors in line of that specific line of work
                  (_zIIp, IFL, SAP etc._)
                  it fined a processor that can handle it and making sure that
                  the same process would go to the same processor so it can
                  use relevant data that is stored in the cache form the
                  previous operation for maximum efficiency.



zDAC            : z Discovery And auto Configuration can help with configuring
                  the HCD (_Hardware and configuration Definition_) helps
                  simplify I/O and some hardware (_mainly FICON_) configuration

VFM             : Virtual Flash Memory
                  helps intensive I/O programs like Db2 and such to minimize and
                  impact by storing the more frequently accessed data thus
                  improving performance

zAWARE          : z Advanced Workload Analysis Reporter. has its own LPAR
                  (_see pic $HOME/Pictures/Ibm-system-map.png ._)
                  it watches every thing going on and compare what it see's to
                  previous data

Millicode       : A micro architecture a layer that is making it possible to
                  add new functionality and still retaining the full
                  backward compatibility

Sysplex         : a way of making multiple systems work as a team. up to 32
                  there is a couple of sysplex's:

                  **monoPlex** : has only one LPAR.

                  **baseSysplex** : All the LPAR's are connected to each other
                     and know of one another.

                  **parallelSysplex** : All the LPAR's are connected to the

                     **Coupling Facility** (_A special LPAR_) typically you would
                     have a backup of this LPAR on another machine/mainframe.
                     the **Coupling Facility** takes care of all the complexity
                     and overhead of the systems working together.
### sysplex component's
                  - **STP** : (_Server Time Protocol_) synchronies time between the
                    systems.
                  - **GRS** : (_Global Resource Serialization_) this allow to
                    multiple systems to access the same resource concurrently
                    serializing when necessary to allow exclusive access.

## Data areas:
```
ASCB     : Address Space Co
PSA      : Prefix in offset 0
WTO/R    : write to the console
```

ENQ      : checks if the resource is available and if it is it locks it for
           updating, editing etc.

DEQ      : the oposite of ENQ it releases the lock to of them is used by GRS.



                  - **XCF** : (_cross Coupling Facility_) this manages communications
                    between applications in a sysplex allows you to issue a
                    command on behalf of another application in the system.
                    This what makes the sysplex communicate as a whole.
                  - **CouplingLinks** : this connect LPAR to processors, **without**
                    these accessing memory on deferent physical systems would
                    have to run through one of those LPAR's.
                    and these allow direct memory access connections between
                    the **sysplex memory and the memory of an attached system.**
                  - **CDS** : (_Coupled Data Set_) contains information related
                    to the parallel sysplex systems.
                    e.g ðŸ‘‡
                    say you are part of a team that needs to do some work on
                    one database, codebase,,,
                    so to make things easy you need to keep a list/ledger
                    so you wont runover someone else's work and vise versa.

CEC             : a physical cage or drawer that holds the processors in the
                  system


IRD             : intelligent Resource Director (_IRD_)
                  can manage LPAR clusters and LPAR cpu management
                  - Dynamic Channel Path Management (_DCPM_)
                    FICON channel bandwidth which is primarily used for
                    connections to storage devices

CSS               - Channel Subsystem Priority Queuing
                    Allows I/O requests in the Channel Subsystem (_CSS_) to
                    have priorities assigned to them
CHPID           :

SMF             : "Systems Management Facility" Activity Reporting
                  almost like a database for tracking events.
                  good for diagnosing problems audeting transactions.

USS             : Unix Services

### I/O, Disk & tape config
ICKDSF          : config data sets that defines Labels for disks,tapes,etc.
                  e.g:
                  `VOL=SER=12345`
DSCB            : Data set Control Block
                  in the old days some times to unlock a tape you would ZAP
                  the tape with a ZAP utiliti to go over the bits and to flip
                  the necessary one to unlock the tape.
VTOC            : hase 6 DSCB's usually the fifth DSCB has volume space info.
VVDS            : vsam volume dataset    like vtoc for vsam files
                  so if you have vsam datasets on dasd you need to have VVDS
                  beside the vtoc so you can find the datasets

                  vvr,nvr SYS1.VVDS.Vxxxx
ICKDSF            TO initialize a new dasd makes the vtoc.

## NETWORKING
Hyper sockets   : virtual connections that allow you to connect to a z/VM z/OS
                  or Linux systems after you define a virtual connection
                  (_a Hyper socket_ ðŸ˜‰)
                  so you can mix and match to the os it looks just like a

                  HyperSockets "B"
                        has 3 connections 1 of them is the same machine as "A"

                        - z/OS(2)
                  HyperSockets "C"
                        has 6 connections 1 to a z/VM, 3 to the internal os's
                        that is running in the z/VM and another 2 connections
                        - Linux(3)
